# FOLDING@HOME - Microsoft for the win!

From the FAH team [website](https://foldingathome.org/about/):

"Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics."

## Why did I created this repo?


## Let's get started

I have created multiple instructions and ways to deploy the FAH client. Some are manual and very straight forward, and also just a bit more advanced one. Here are the scenarios and the ways to get started:

* I am a Windows user and just want to install the client and start folding
* I am a MacOS user and just want to install the client and start folding
* I don't want to install anything locally but I'm cool with deploying a Docker container (TBD)
* I want to use a "Ready-to-go" Azure VM to do the heavy lifting (TBD)
