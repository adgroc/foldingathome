# FOLDING@HOME - Microsoft for the win!

From the FAH team [website](https://foldingathome.org/about/):

"Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics."

## How does it work?

The FAH team are really the experts! Visit the [FAQ page](https://foldingathome.org/category/how-fah-works/) to learn more. 

## Why did I created this repo?

I want to contribute the effort of raising awareness as well making sure people can deploy and start folding an easy fashion as fast as possible. 

## Let's get started

I have created multiple instructions and ways to deploy the FAH client. Some are manual and very straight forward, and also just a bit more advanced one. Here are the scenarios and the ways to get started:

* [I am a Windows user and just want to install the client and start folding](docs/Windows.md)
* [I am a MacOS user and just want to install the client and start folding](docs/MacOS.md)
* I don't want to install anything locally but I'm cool with deploying a Docker container (TBD)
* I want to use a "Ready-to-go" Azure VM to do the heavy lifting (TBD)

## Contributing

Please do in any way possible which make sense to you. The COVID-19 is hitting hard and we are all in this together. If you have creative ideas please open a pull request or shoot me an email to likamrat@microsoft.com.
